# The New York Experience
Airbnb is a rapidly growing company that provides users with the opportunity to rent houses/apartments on short notice. 
Due to the size of the company, users have several options on what place to rent. It is a challenge to determine which 
place is the best for a specific user: certain users may look for cheaper spots, others may look for highly eloquent 
spots, while others may simply care about the rating of the host.

For our CIS 550 project, our group implemented database-driven webpage that allows users to filter Airbnb listings in New York to find their perfect match. In 
addition to providing general information about Airbnb listings across the US, we plan to specifically analyze the 
correlation between party activity in NYC with Airbnbs. If someone is looking to have a fun time in NYC, we may suggest 
an Airbnb near a bar, which is the source of many noise complaints. Meanwhile, if someone is looking for a relaxing, 
tranquil trip in NYC, we will suggest an Airbnb in a quiet neighborhood.
